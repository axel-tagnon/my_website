title: LBS Black in Business Club
---

As a Black in Business Scholar, I always knew that I would get involved with the club in some way shape or form. After talking with current members of the Executive Committee, I realised that the VP Careers position was the best way for me to have an impact. Indeed, while I had measured BiB’s potential as a career platform before joining the school, the ambition and vision of the club's Careers Senior Vice President reaffirmed my desire to take up this position. Given my past experiences in London (American Express, Värde Partners, Castlelake), I am convinced that my network will enable me to drive value for the club.
