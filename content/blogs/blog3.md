My name is Axel Tagnon and I’m a Black in Business Scholar on the MFA programme at London Business School. While I was born in France, I experienced living in a range of different countries including India, Norway and South Africa. I then moved to the UK, where I studied statistics at University College London prior to joining LBS. While at UCL, I did a few internships in both private equity and corporate finance. Finally, beyond my academic and professional interests, I’ve been go-karting for as long as I can remember and that’s led me to be a huge Formula 1 fan!
